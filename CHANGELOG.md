# Changelog

## Draft

### :rocket: Features

* Added lots of tests.
* Upgraded to Qt/PySide 6.5
* Fixed selection bug where first selecting a column and then selecting a single
  cell within that column did not update all column information correctly

### :hammer: Refactoring

* Completely overhauled separation of concerns between GUI and data model
  layers. There are now more layers and many methods are now more focused and
  well tested. Should also make it easier to switch GUI toolkits in the future.


## 1.8.0

### :rocket: Features

* Added `--no-update-check` flag to skip updates on startup
* Improved resilience against NaNs when fitting a model

### :beetle: Fixes

* Check for both OS and CPU hardware for updates (e.g. differentiate between Intel and Apple Silicon)
* Include link to release notes in update window
* Much improved dialog for available updates
* Slim down Windows application

## 1.7.0

### What's Changed

We now have fully signed, notarized and native builds for Apple Silicon. Builds for Windows are submitted to Microsoft for analysis so there should never be any warning that Tailor is untrusted, from an unidentified developer, or not commonly downloaded ðŸ˜€. Unfortunately, universal builds are very difficult because some Python packages don't supply universal wheels and GitHub Actions does not have Apple Silicon machines. So, only Windows builds are done on GitHub Actions and Mac builds are done on two local machines.

### :package: Build system

* Signed, notarized and native builds for Macs on Intel and Apple Silicon


## 1.6.1

### What's Changed

I no longer use release drafter. It is a nice idea but I had to create pull requests for _everything_ or it wouldn't show up in the release notes and I still had to copy/paste these notes to the CHANGELOG.md file. Furthermore, I had to rerun the GitHub Action if I made a typo in the PR title.

### :package: Build system

* Ditched release drafter, too much overkill.
* We can use the newest briefcase on Windows (beeware/briefcase#930)


### :rocket: Features
### :beetle: Fixes

* Accept NumPy arrays as output of functions


## 1.6.0
### Whatâ€™s Changed

This release includes several enhancements, the most notable being support for copy and paste in the data sheet. It is now easy to copy and paste entire columns, or copy data to and from a spreadsheet application like Numbers or Excel. The plot interface is also a bit improved when a model includes a large number of parameters. Since the list of parameters is now scrollable the size stays relatively small so there's more room for the model function and the information window.

Several bugs are fixed including a fatal unicode decoding bug. Under the hood parts of the code are refactored to reduce complexity and make it easier to further develop the code base.

### :rocket: Features

* Normalise column names when importing CSV (#14)

### :beetle: Fixes

* Solves weird behaviour when editing cells caused by resetting the model when calculating values

### Whatâ€™s Changed

This is a minor bugfix update.

### :beetle: Fixes

* Fix: recalculate values when clearing cells


## v1.4.0

Some enhancements for easier reuse of projects: import new data into current project and clear contents of selected cells.

### :rocket: Features

* Clear selected cells (#12)
* Import CSV file into project (#11)


## v1.3.0

## v1.2.0

### Whatâ€™s Changed

This is a minor update.

### :rocket: Features

* Added a semicolon to the list of CSV-like column delimiters
* Improved error handling of CSV imports, including more useful help messages

### :package: Build System

* We now use GitHub Actions to build our MacOS and Windows installers


## v1.1.1

### Bugfixes

* When a model function previously was correct but is now broken (e.g. missing
  closing bracket) a fit would be performed with the old model function. This
  hid the error message complaining about the model, which was not ideal... Now,
  trying to perform a fit will really complain about the broken model.


### Features

* There are now several file filters available to import *.txt or other files.
* Exceptions during the opening of Tailor projects are now better handled and reported.


## v1.1.0

### Features

* Import not-quite-CSV-files (tabs, comments, etc.) with a nice preview window.
* Icon size corrected for MacOS.
* Ask for confirmation *before* opening or importing files or projects, not *after* selecting the file.


## v1.0.2

### Bugfixes

* Fixes a crash when calculating the relative error when the parameter value is zero.


## v1.0.1

### Bugfixes

* When entering constants (like 0.8) in a calculated column, the single-valued
  float type could not be cast using the .astype() method triggering an
  exception.
* When changing the draw curve region option (e.g. from 'On data point' to 'On
  full axis') the plot was not updated correctly.


## v1.0.0

Ready for deployment in our student labs! (ðŸ¤ž)

### Bugfixes

* When editing a cell, the current value no longer disappears.
* Recalculate column values whenever a data value changes. This did not happen
  if you navigated away from the cell instead of pressing enter.
* Better support saving and loading project files when a column gets renamed and
  the fit object still has the old name.
* When you write 1 * 10 ** 20 instead of 1e20 this is not a float but a very
  large integer. This could result in calculated values being cast to dtype
  'object' which caused problems (e.g. with fits). Now always casts to float64
  after calculations.


### Features

* New custom icon. Handdrawn, so will probably be replaced with something nicer.
* Lots of confirmation dialogs before closing files or tabs.
* You can now rename columns without breaking plots and fits. You still need to
  manually update the model expression, however.
* The results box is now the information box. It also displays the data sources
  which update when columns get renamed.
* Export PNG files with a resolution of 300 DPI (much better!)
* Show much more digits in table cells.
* Now catches exceptions during opening and saving projects with details you can
  copy/paste and send to the developer!
* Lots of small UI tweaks and improvements.


## v0.9.0

### Bugfixes

* Plots update when rows are removed
* Fixed: empty plots when exporting before doing a fit


### Features

* You can now save and open Tailor projects!
* When performing a fit, the initial fit is hidden. When changing parameters it
  is made visible.
* You can now choose part of the data as fit domain. Only data in the domain
  will be fitted, the rest will be ignored. The domain edges is draggable with
  the mouse.
* Fit domain is visible in exported graphs.
* Fit errors are now displayed in the statusbar.
* Statusbar messages now stay visible indefinitely.
* Improved displayed precision in table view (spreadsheet) and fit results.
* When adding columns, the column name is selected and focused so you can
  immediately type a new column name.
* Added degrees of freedom and relative errors to fit results.
* You now have several options for plotting best-fit curves: on data points,
  only on the fit domain, or on the full axis.
* Several UI tweaks.
