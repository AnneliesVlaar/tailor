* Normalise column names when importing CSV (#14)

### :beetle: Fixes

* Solves weird behaviour when editing cells caused by resetting the model when calculating values


## v1.4.1

### Whatâ€™s Changed

This is a minor bugfix update.

### :beetle: Fixes

* Fix: recalculate values when clearing cells


## v1.4.0

### :rocket: Features

* Clear selected cells (#12)
* Import CSV file into project (#11)


## v1.3.0

### Whatâ€™s Changed

This is a bugfix update with some minor new features.

### :rocket: Features

* You can now use backspace and delete keys to clear cell contents
* Empty cells are now handled gracefully by plots, fits and in open/save projects
* Column labels are now more consistently cleared when changing selections

### :beetle: Fixes

* Fix handling of Inf and NaN values (#8), fixes #5 and #7 
* Exceptions when saving plots fail silently (#6)
* Removing calculated column keeps name in memory (#1)

### :package: Build System

## v1.2.0

### Whatâ€™s Changed

This is a minor update.

### :rocket: Features

* Added a semicolon to the list of CSV-like column delimiters
* Improved error handling of CSV imports, including more useful help messages

### :package: Build System

* We now use GitHub Actions to build our MacOS and Windows installers


## v1.1.1

### Bugfixes

* When a model function previously was correct but is now broken (e.g. missing
  closing bracket) a fit would be performed with the old model function. This
  hid the error message complaining about the model, which was not ideal... Now,
  trying to perform a fit will really complain about the broken model.


### Features

* There are now several file filters available to import *.txt or other files.
* Exceptions during the opening of Tailor projects are now better handled and reported.


## v1.1.0

### Features

* Import not-quite-CSV-files (tabs, comments, etc.) with a nice preview window.
* Icon size corrected for MacOS.
* Ask for confirmation *before* opening or importing files or projects, not *after* selecting the file.


## v1.0.2

### Bugfixes

* Fixes a crash when calculating the relative error when the parameter value is zero.


## v1.0.1

### Bugfixes

* When entering constants (like 0.8) in a calculated column, the single-valued
  float type could not be cast using the .astype() method triggering an
  exception.
* When changing the draw curve region option (e.g. from 'On data point' to 'On
  full axis') the plot was not updated correctly.


## v1.0.0

Ready for deployment in our student labs! (ðŸ¤ž)

### Bugfixes

* When editing a cell, the current value no longer disappears.
* Recalculate column values whenever a data value changes. This did not happen
  if you navigated away from the cell instead of pressing enter.
* Better support saving and loading project files when a column gets renamed and
  the fit object still has the old name.
* When you write 1 * 10 ** 20 instead of 1e20 this is not a float but a very
  large integer. This could result in calculated values being cast to dtype
  'object' which caused problems (e.g. with fits). Now always casts to float64
  after calculations.


### Features

* New custom icon. Handdrawn, so will probably be replaced with something nicer.
* Lots of confirmation dialogs before closing files or tabs.
* You can now rename columns without breaking plots and fits. You still need to
  manually update the model expression, however.
* The results box is now the information box. It also displays the data sources
  which update when columns get renamed.
* Export PNG files with a resolution of 300 DPI (much better!)
* Show much more digits in table cells.
* Now catches exceptions during opening and saving projects with details you can
  copy/paste and send to the developer!
* Lots of small UI tweaks and improvements.


## v0.9.0

### Bugfixes

* Plots update when rows are removed
* Fixed: empty plots when exporting before doing a fit


### Features

* You can now save and open Tailor projects!
* When performing a fit, the initial fit is hidden. When changing parameters it
  is made visible.
* You can now choose part of the data as fit domain. Only data in the domain
  will be fitted, the rest will be ignored. The domain edges is draggable with
  the mouse.
* Fit domain is visible in exported graphs.
* Fit errors are now displayed in the statusbar.
* Statusbar messages now stay visible indefinitely.
* Improved displayed precision in table view (spreadsheet) and fit results.
* When adding columns, the column name is selected and focused so you can
  immediately type a new column name.
* Added degrees of freedom and relative errors to fit results.
* You now have several options for plotting best-fit curves: on data points,
  only on the fit domain, or on the full axis.
* Several UI tweaks.


## v0.8.0

### Features

* Spreadsheet-like editing of data
* Import and export of CSV files
* Add / remove columns or rows
* Add columns based on mathematical expressions
* Create multiple scatter plots with X/Y error bars
* Fit custom models to data based on mathematical expressions
* Models can include a wide range of Python operators and mathematical functions
* Parameters are automatically deduced from the model expression and displayed
  in the user interface
* Start values can be easily changes and an initial fit is updated in the plot
  window
* Bounds on parameters and the ability to fix a parameter to a particular value
* Fit results include reduced chi-square statistic and parameter value and error
  estimations
* Easily adjustable axis labels and ranges
* Zooming and panning of the plot
* Export plot as PNG (bitmap) or PDF (vector) images
