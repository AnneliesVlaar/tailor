Development
-----------

Set up a development environment with::

    $ conda create -n analyser python=3.8
    $ conda activate analyser
    $ pip install briefcase

Then, for installing dependencies and running the app in the dev environment::

    $ briefcase dev

For creating a (clean) application::

    $ briefcase create

And running the application::

    $ briefcase run

Updating the application can be quickly done with::

    $ briefcase update

or update and run in one go::

    $ briefcase run -u

If you need to install extra (!) dependencies::

    $ briefcase update -d

Mind that this does not *remove* dependencies. You must recreate the application to do that. Creating installers for the application::

    $ briefcase package --no-sign
